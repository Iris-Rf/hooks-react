        Rick and Morty (in English: Rick and Morty) is an American animated
        television series for adults created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon in
        2013 for Adult Swim, it also aired on Cartoon Network. The series
        follows the misadventures of a scientist, Rick Sanchez, and his easily
        influenced grandson, Morty, as they navigate between domestic life and
        space, time, and intergalactic travel. Justin Roiland, the co-creator of
        the series and Johnny Knoxville are in charge of the main voices of
        Morty and Rick, the series also includes the voices of Chris Parnell,
        Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke. The series originated from a
        rudimentary short film animated by Roiland for the Channel 101 film
        festival called Doc and Mharti, a parody of the main leads from Back to
        the Future. When NBC fired Harmon in 2013 over arguments between him and
        executives from the series he had created, Community, he and Roiland
        developed a series based on the characters Roilan had already created.
